 <section class="home-main-section">
    <p>My name is Sam, I've been on planet earth since 1986 and I hail from London via Watford, but I now live in Cambridgeshire.
        I enjoy meeting new people and learning new things, in addition to learning to code, I am currently teaching myself to paint tattoo flash and enjoying my first summer of
        gardening, growing tomatoes, chillies and herbs for the first time currently.  I have a dog called Eli, he's 4 and very much my little dude.
    </p>
    <p>My professional journey has been a rollercoaster so far.  I began working in retail, then followed my love of food into working in kitchens and bakeries.
        While doing so, I earned a degree in Food Sciences and upon graduation, decided to venture into New Product Development for a large scale bakery.
        After several succesful and enjoyable years, I experienced a redundancy.</p>
        <p>My redundancy unexpectedly led me into the Tech industry by chance, where I spent 6 years working in Account Management and Customer Success.  Due to health reasons I relocated from London to Cambridgeshire
            and took some time away from the world of work to heal and figure out my next move in life.  Which leads me to joining the Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp with Tech Ed.</p></section>
